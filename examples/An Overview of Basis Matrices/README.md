Two types of Basis Matrices are currently implemented, all support both 1D and 2D.
- Basis Matrices constructed from basis functions, e.g. b-splines, Fourier, Radial Bump Basis Function
- Basis Matrices constructed so that their Hat Matrix is an approximation to a Gaussian Process, using Spectral Decomposition
